            <hr class="hr-internal" />

            <p>Air ducts are the passages found inside your heating and cooling system that make it possible for hot or cold air to circulate throughout your home or business. Your air ducts are often a haven for air contaminants, requiring routine air duct cleaning services. Unique Services’ residential and commercial air duct cleaning services can rid your Bradenton-area home or office of dust, debris, and pollen that may have accumulated in your HVAC system over time.</p>
            <p>As each system circulates air throughout your home or office, dust becomes airborne, triggering sinus infections, allergies, and asthma and causing many unexplained health symptoms, such as coughing or nasal congestion. Our skilled HVAC service technicians use a specialized vacuum to extract contaminants from your air ducts quickly and effectively, so you don’t encounter damage from the debris. There’s no better way to ensure that you have the cleanest air possible in your home or business.</p>

            <h2 class="h2-internal mt-5">BENEFITS OF HAVING CLEAN AIR DUCTS IN YOUR HOME OR BUSINESS</h2>
            <hr class="hr-internal" />
            <p>A heating or cooling system with clogged air ducts is not able to heat or cool your space as efficiently as a clean system. A restricted airflow means your system will have to run longer and burn more energy to circulate the air throughout your home or office. Regular air duct cleaning services may help improve your indoor air quality. However, depending upon how many people and pets you have in your home and the types of filters you use on your HVAC system, the frequency of these air duct cleaning services may vary. It’s usually recommended at least once every 4-7 years on average.</p>

            <h2 class="h2-internal mt-5">HOW TO TELL IF YOU NEED AIR DUCT CLEANING SERVICES</h2>
            <hr class="hr-internal" />
            <p>Since your air ducts are typically located behind your walls or out of sight, it can be easy for many people to forget about having them cleaned. Here are some ways you can tell if it’s time for our air duct cleaning services in your Bradenton-area home or office:</p>

            <ul class="ul-spaced">
                <li><strong>Visible Mold Growth</strong> – If you’ve noticed visible mold growth along your air ducts or any other component of your heating or cooling system, it’s time to call in the HVAC experts. Mold presents many respiratory health issues that can be a grave danger to you and your family.</li>
                <li><strong>Clogged Air Ducts</strong> – You can usually tell when your air ducts are clogged by opening your vent covers and taking a look. Thick coatings of dust and debris should be addressed soon to avoid restricted airflow circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Higher Energy Bills</strong> – If you’ve noticed higher energy bills, your HVAC system may not be running efficiently due to clogged air ducts.</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Cleaning</strong> – If you’ve noticed a need for more cleaning than usual to keep your home or office free from dust, it could be time for an air duct cleaning.</li>
            </ul>
