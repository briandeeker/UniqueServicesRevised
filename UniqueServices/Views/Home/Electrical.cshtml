            <hr class="hr-internal" />
            <p>Life without working electricity is not only inconvenient, but it can also even be dangerous under certain circumstances. If ignored, faulty wiring can lead to electrical fires and severe damages. While you may be tempted to try and fix an electrical issue yourself, serious injury or death from an electrical shock may occur if it’s addressed by an amateur. Additionally, your insurance company may not elect to cover your damages unless the repair work’s been completed by a certified electrician. Obtain peace of mind that your electrical system’s functioning properly by relying on Unique Services in West Florida.</p>

            <h2 class="h2-internal mt-5">WARNING SIGNS YOU MAY NEED TO CALL AN ELECTRICIAN</h2>
            <hr class="hr-internal" />
            <p>As previously mentioned, electrical repairs and troubleshooting are always best left to professionals who are knowledgeable about electrical safety codes. If you encounter any of the following issues, you should call our licensed residential and commercial electricians in Bradenton right away:</p>

            <ul class="ul-spaced">
                <li><strong>Outdated Systems</strong> – If your home or business has an old electrical system, you could have any number of issues lurking on the horizon, including faulty wiring, rust, or outdated circuits. Don’t wait until it’s too late to get your electrical system upgraded!</li>
                <li><strong>Overloaded Outlets</strong> – Many electrical fires are caused by having too many extension cords plugged into the same outlet. Our electricians would be more than happy to install additional outlets in your home or business!</li>
                <li><strong>Overloaded Circuits</strong> – Your outlets or power switches should never feel hot to the touch. This may indicate that you have overloaded circuits, which could result in an electrical shock. Flickering lights are also another common warning sign that you may have overloaded circuits.</li>
                <li><strong>Tripping Circuit Breakers</strong> – If it seems like your circuit breakers are constantly tripping, our electricians may need to install a separate electrical circuit for certain appliances.</li>
            </ul>
