            <hr class="hr-internal" />

            <p>Unique Services’ history dates back to 1951, when Sarasota and Bradenton were small ranch towns on Florida’s Gulf Coast. In 1975, the company changed its name to Unique Air, Inc., and the company prospered as the area’s growth exploded.</p>
            <p>Today, operations have expanded far beyond air conditioning system services. Unique Services has risen as Florida’s premier provider of services, installations, and repairs for HVAC, plumbing, and electrical. Our expansion to 150 employees, and a large fleet of fully equipped service vans, was the result of our complete dedication to customer satisfaction. Office staff, technicians, and crew members are coached in the company’s culture of service. Company leaders have invested in efficiency technologies with one goal—improve the customer experience from the first call forward.</p>
            <p>Our customer service is known throughout the state, and our recent Sarasota Chamber Customer Excellence Award and our Lennox Customer Satisfaction Award (based on independent surveys) are proof of what our customers already know they will experience—outstanding service and excellent workmanship. Not only do we have exceptional employees, but we offer the best services for plumbing, electrical, swimming pool, and air conditioning repair that Sarasota and surrounding counties have ever seen.</p>
