            <h2 class="h2-internal mt-5">WARNING SIGNS YOU MAY NEED TO CALL A PLUMBER</h2>
            <hr class="hr-internal" />
            <p>While you may be tempted to tackle a plumbing repair on your own, it’s usually in your best interest to defer to an expert. Here are the top warning signs that you may need to call an experienced plumber:</p>

            <ul class="ul-spaced">
                <li><strong>Clogged Drains</strong> – If your bathroom or kitchen sink is slow to drain, just about anything from built-up food wastes to a small rodent could be the reason for your blockage. While you could spend hours trying to unclog your drain yourself, our drain-cleaning equipment is often more effective, even for the most stubborn clogs.</li>
                <li><strong>Backflow Issues</strong> – Backflow issues can be among the most unpleasant and serious plumbing emergencies. If you’ve noticed foul-smelling backflow water gurgling forth from your sink, you could have anything from a pressure issue to a broken backflow preventer device. Wastewater should never mix with your potable water supply!</li>
                <li><strong>Burst Pipes</strong> – Bursting pipes can cause flooding and other headaches. Because pipes are found behind walls and underneath your foundation, it’s often difficult to pinpoint which pipe has burst without the proper equipment and expertise.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Water Pressure</strong> – Taking a shower with low water pressure is not only wasting your time, but it’s also wasting your money. As your plumbing continues to work harder to operate efficiently, you could see increases in your water bill.</li>
                <li><strong>Flooding</strong> – Flooding can lead to property damages, mold growth, and respiratory issues for you and your family if it’s not dealt with immediately. We can help you figure out the cause for your leak and prevent it from happening again.</li>
            </ul>
