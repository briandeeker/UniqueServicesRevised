            <h2 class="h2-internal mt-5">Signs You May Need to Call an HVAC Technician</h2>
            <hr class="hr-internal" />
            <p>During the scorching summer months in the West Florida heat, a properly functioning air conditioner is a must-have to keep you and your family cool. Air conditioning also helps keep your indoor air free of dust, providing everyone with clean air, as well as relief from many allergy and asthma symptoms. During the colder months, you rely on your heating system to keep your family warm. Hiring Unique Services for professional HVAC maintenance ensures your heating and cooling systems continue to operate efficiently. Here are some warning signs that it may be time for you to call one of our HVAC technicians to take a look at your heating and air conditioning in the Bradenton area:</p>

            <h3 class="h3-internal mt-5">Increased Energy Bills</h3>
            <p>Increasing energy bills are your first warning that your HVAC system is working too hard and burning too much energy. You may need a repair, or it could be time for a replacement to a more energy-efficient furnace or air conditioner.</p>

            <h3 class="h3-internal mt-5">Unusual Odors or Noises</h3>
            <p>Have you noticed a burning odor or unusual noises whenever your unit cycles on and off? Don’t ignore it, as it could indicate an electrical issue that could lead to a fire if you’re not careful.</p>

            <h3 class="h3-internal mt-5">Weak System Output</h3>
            <p>If your system isn’t producing consistent hot or cold air the way it used to, you could have anything from a clogged fan to a loose fan belt or dead motor. It’s better to be safe than sorry and have our HVAC repair experts take a look at it!</p>

            <h3 class="h3-internal mt-5">Moisture</h3>
            <p>You should not see any signs of condensation on your heating or cooling unit. If moisture is present, you could have leaky ductwork or broken parts. You should turn it off immediately and call <a href="tel:9413770153" class="services-details">941-377-0153</a> to schedule a service appointment with our <a class="services-details" asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Contact"><strong>local HVAC experts!</strong></a></p>
