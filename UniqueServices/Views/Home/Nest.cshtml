            <h2 class="h2-internal mt-5">NEST THERMOSTAT</h2>
            <hr class="hr-internal" />
            <p>Generally, people change the temperature in their home to save money while they’re away. However, some may forget to make this adjustment to their thermostat before walking out the door. This may result in higher cooling and heating bills. If you have experienced this before, Nest is your solution.</p>
            <p>No need to understand complicated schedule programming either. Nest programs itself by learning your schedule. When it detects you’re not home, it will set itself to an energy-efficient temperature. You can also control your thermostat straight from your phone. Nest has proven to help lower heating bills up to 12% and cooling bills up to 15%.</p>

                    <p>Whether you place them indoors or outdoors, Nest Cams give you peace of mind while you’re away from home. Nest Cams take only minutes to set up and include night vision, live HD streaming, and available cloud storage—all the tools you need to keep tabs on what matters to you 24/7.</p>
                    <p>For security outdoors, Nest Cam Outdoor is a great way to monitor your surroundings. This smart camera can even alert you when it sees someone it doesn’t recognize, and zoom in on any suspicious activity. To keep an eye on the inside of your home when you’re away, Nest Cam Indoor looks for motion and allows you to hear what’s happening in your home. Both cameras record up to 30 days of video footage that can be accessed live from anywhere, and stored in secure cloud storage with a Nest Aware subscription.</p>

            <hr class="hr-internal" />

            <p>Nest Protect will alert your phone and let you know what the problem is, where it’s coming from—even while you’re not home. From the Nest app, you can silence, test, and modify alarms, as well as know when the batteries are low or need to be replaced. But with a 10-year battery lifespan, you’ll be covered for years to come.</p>
            <p>Nest Protect also detects carbon monoxide, an invisible and potentially harmful gas. A subtle green glow emits from Nest Protect at night to let you know it’s working—so you can breathe easy and know that your home is protected.</p>
